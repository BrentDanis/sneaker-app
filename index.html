                         We give you the ability to keep your sneakers clean at all times. The sneakers make the man and the man needs clean sneakers. As people we make snap judgments of other people when we first meet them and 90% of that judgment comes when they look down at your sneakers, so itâ€™s best to keep them clean at all times.
